        <p>I M Ahmer Tahir, write these blogs to support the content that i upload on YouTube and it is also copyright free. It is impossible to write code in a file and share it with people on YouTube. People mostly hesitate to download a file from the internet due to viruses. So, to provide them with code that i write in my videos, i write blog and share it with all of them so they can easily access it.</p>
